# Interesting Tasks And Algorithms
Here I publish some interesting tasks and algorithms

1. Fibonacci. Recursive and in loop.
2. Singly linked list reverse. Recursive and in loop.
3. Ping pong with 2 threads using Monitor synchronization.
4. Sorting algorithms  with unit tests:
<ol type="a">
  <li>Bubble sort</li>
  <li>Quick sort, Quick sort Desc</li>
  <li>Radix sort</li>
</ol>
Each task in separate project. For investigate set project as startup an debug it.
