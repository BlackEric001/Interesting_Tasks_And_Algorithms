# Interesting Tasks And Algorithms
Here I publish some interesting tasks and algorithms

1. Fibonacci. Recursive and in loop.
2. Singly linked list reverse. Recursive and in loop.
3. Ping pong with 2 threads using Monitor synchronization.
4. Sorting algorithms:
    i) Bubble 
    ii) Quick with unit tests

Each task in separate project. For investigate set project as startup an debug it.
